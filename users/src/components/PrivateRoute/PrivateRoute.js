//Requirements:
// 1. This component has to have the same API as the react router route component (< Route />)
// 2. This component has to render a route component from react router and pass all of the props through to it.
// 3. It has to check for a token (JWT) if the user is authenticated, then render the component. Otherwise, the user will be redirected to the login page (/login)
